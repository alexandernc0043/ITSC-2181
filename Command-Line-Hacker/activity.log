Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /opt/peda/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)

    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /opt/peda/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       This manual page documents version 5.45 of the [1mfile [22mcommand.[m
[m
       [1mfile [22mtests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  There are three sets of tests, performed in this order: filesystem  tests,  magic  tests,  and[m
       language tests.  The [4mfirst[24m test that succeeds causes the file type to be printed.[m
[m
       The  type  printed  will  usually contain one of the words [4mtext[24m (the file contains only printing characters and a few common control characters and is[m
       probably safe to read on an ASCII terminal), [4mexecutable[24m (the file contains the result of compiling a program in a form  understandable  to  some  UNIX[m
       kernel  or  another),  or [4mdata[24m meaning anything else (data is usually ‚Äúbinary‚Äù or non-printable).  Exceptions are well-known file formats (core files,[m
       tar archives) that are known to contain binary data.  When modifying magic files or the program itself, make sure to [4mpreserve[24m [4mthese[24m  [4mkeywords[24m.   Users[m
       depend  on knowing that all the readable files in a directory have the word ‚Äútext‚Äù printed.  Don't do as Berkeley did and change ‚Äúshell commands text‚Äù[m
       to ‚Äúshell script‚Äù.[m
[m
       The filesystem tests are based on examining the return from a [4mstat[24m(2) system call.  The program checks to see if the file is empty, or  if  it's  some[m
       sort  of  special  file.   Any known file types appropriate to the system you are running on (sockets, symbolic links, or named pipes (FIFOs) on those[m
       systems that implement them) are intuited if they are defined in the system header file <[4msys/stat.h[24m>.[m
[m
       The magic tests are used to check for files with data in particular fixed formats.  The canonical example of this is  a  binary  executable  (compiled[m
       program) a.out file, whose format is defined in <[4melf.h[24m>, <[4ma.out.h[24m> and possibly <[4mexec.h[24m> in the standard include directory.  These files have a ‚Äúmagic[m
       number‚Äù  stored  in  a  particular place near the beginning of the file that tells the UNIX operating system that the file is a binary executable, and[m
       which of several types thereof.  The concept of a ‚Äúmagic number‚Äù has been applied by extension to data files.  Any file with some invariant identifier[m
       at a small fixed offset into the file can usually be described in this way.  The information identifying these files is read from /etc/magic  and  the[m
       compiled  magic file [4m/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc[24m, or the files in the directory [4m/usr/share/misc/magic[24m if the compiled file does not exist.  In addition,[m
       if [4m$HOME/.magic.mgc[24m or [4m$HOME/.magic[24m exists, it will be used in preference to the system magic files.[m
[m
       If a file does not match any of the entries in the magic file, it is examined to see if it seems to be a text file.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non-ISO  8-bit[m
       extended-ASCII  character sets (such as those used on Macintosh and IBM PC systems), UTF-8-encoded Unicode, UTF-16-encoded Unicode, and EBCDIC charac‚Äê[m
       ter sets can be distinguished by the different ranges and sequences of bytes that constitute printable text in each set.  If  a  file  passes  any  of[m
       these  tests,  its character set is reported.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, UTF-8, and extended-ASCII files are identified as ‚Äútext‚Äù because they will be mostly[m
       readable on nearly any terminal; UTF-16 and EBCDIC are only ‚Äúcharacter data‚Äù because, while they contain text, it is text that will  require  transla‚Äê[m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       This manual page documents version 5.45 of the [1mfile [22mcommand.[m
[m
       [1mfile [22mtests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  There are three sets of tests, performed in this order: filesystem  tests,  magic  tests,  and[m
       language tests.  The [4mfirst[24m test that succeeds causes the file type to be printed.[m
[m
       The  type  printed  will  usually contain one of the words [4mtext[24m (the file contains only printing characters and a few common control characters and is[m
       probably safe to read on an ASCII terminal), [4mexecutable[24m (the file contains the result of compiling a program in a form  understandable  to  some  UNIX[m
       kernel  or  another),  or [4mdata[24m meaning anything else (data is usually ‚Äúbinary‚Äù or non-printable).  Exceptions are well-known file formats (core files,[m
       tar archives) that are known to contain binary data.  When modifying magic files or the program itself, make sure to [4mpreserve[24m [4mthese[24m  [4mkeywords[24m.   Users[m
       depend  on knowing that all the readable files in a directory have the word ‚Äútext‚Äù printed.  Don't do as Berkeley did and change ‚Äúshell commands text‚Äù[m
       to ‚Äúshell script‚Äù.[m
[m
       The filesystem tests are based on examining the return from a [4mstat[24m(2) system call.  The program checks to see if the file is empty, or  if  it's  some[m
       sort  of  special  file.   Any known file types appropriate to the system you are running on (sockets, symbolic links, or named pipes (FIFOs) on those[m
       systems that implement them) are intuited if they are defined in the system header file <[4msys/stat.h[24m>.[m
[m
       The magic tests are used to check for files with data in particular fixed formats.  The canonical example of this is  a  binary  executable  (compiled[m
       program) a.out file, whose format is defined in <[4melf.h[24m>, <[4ma.out.h[24m> and possibly <[4mexec.h[24m> in the standard include directory.  These files have a ‚Äúmagic[m
       number‚Äù  stored  in  a  particular place near the beginning of the file that tells the UNIX operating system that the file is a binary executable, and[m
       which of several types thereof.  The concept of a ‚Äúmagic number‚Äù has been applied by extension to data files.  Any file with some invariant identifier[m
       at a small fixed offset into the file can usually be described in this way.  The information identifying these files is read from /etc/magic  and  the[m
       compiled  magic file [4m/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc[24m, or the files in the directory [4m/usr/share/misc/magic[24m if the compiled file does not exist.  In addition,[m
       if [4m$HOME/.magic.mgc[24m or [4m$HOME/.magic[24m exists, it will be used in preference to the system magic files.[m
[m
       If a file does not match any of the entries in the magic file, it is examined to see if it seems to be a text file.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non-ISO  8-bit[m
       extended-ASCII  character sets (such as those used on Macintosh and IBM PC systems), UTF-8-encoded Unicode, UTF-16-encoded Unicode, and EBCDIC charac‚Äê[m
       ter sets can be distinguished by the different ranges and sequences of bytes that constitute printable text in each set.  If  a  file  passes  any  of[m
       these  tests,  its character set is reported.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, UTF-8, and extended-ASCII files are identified as ‚Äútext‚Äù because they will be mostly[m
       readable on nearly any terminal; UTF-16 and EBCDIC are only ‚Äúcharacter data‚Äù because, while they contain text, it is text that will  require  transla‚Äê[m

[1mNAME[0m[m
       find - search for files in a directory hierarchy[m
[m
[1mSYNOPSIS[0m[m
       [1mfind [22m[-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [expression][m
[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of [1mfind[22m.  GNU [1mfind [22msearches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by evaluating the given[m
       expression from left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand side  is  false[m
       for [4mand[24m operations, true for [4mor[24m), at which point [1mfind [22mmoves on to the next file name.  If no starting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.[m
[m
       If  you are using [1mfind [22min an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to search directories that are writable by other[m
       users), you should read the `Security Considerations' chapter of the findutils documentation, which is called [1mFinding Files [22mand comes with  findutils.[m
       That document also includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a more useful source of information.[m
[m
[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       The  [1m-H[22m, [1m-L [22mand [1m-P [22moptions control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following these are taken to be names of files or directo‚Äê[m
       ries to be examined, up to the first argument that begins with `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following arguments  are  taken[m
       to be the expression describing what is to be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current directory is used.  If no expression is given, the ex‚Äê[m
       pression [1m-print [22mis used (but you should probably consider using [1m-print0 [22minstead, anyway).[m
[m
       This  manual  page  talks about `options' within the expression list.  These options control the behaviour of [1mfind [22mbut are specified immediately after[m
       the last path name.  The five `real' options [1m-H[22m, [1m-L[22m, [1m-P[22m, [1m-D [22mand [1m-O [22mmust appear before the first path name, if at all.  A double dash [1m-- [22mcould theoret‚Äê[m
       ically be used to signal that any remaining arguments are not options, but this does not really work due to the way [1mfind [22mdetermines  the  end  of  the[m
       following  path  arguments:  it does that by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a `-').  Now, if a path argument would[m
       start with a `-', then [1mfind [22mwould treat it as expression argument instead.  Thus, to ensure that all start points are taken as such, and especially to[m
       prevent that wildcard patterns expanded by the calling shell are not mistakenly treated as expression arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wild‚Äê[m
       cards or dubious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names starting with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable[m
       to use the GNU option [1m-files0-from [22mto pass arbitrary starting points to [1mfind[22m.[m
[m
       -P     Never follow symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When [1mfind [22mexamines or prints information about files, and the file is a  symbolic[m
              link, the information used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.[m
[m
       -L     Follow  symbolic  links.   When [1mfind [22mexamines or prints information about files, the information used shall be taken from the properties of the[m
              file to which the link points, not from the link itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or [1mfind [22mis unable to examine the file to which the[m
              link points).  Use of this option implies [1m-noleaf[22m.  If you later use the [1m-P [22moption, [1m-noleaf [22mwill still be in effect.  If [1m-L [22mis  in  effect  and[m
              [1mfind [22mdiscovers a symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirectory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.[m
[m
              When  the [1m-L [22moption is in effect, the [1m-type [22mpredicate will always match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to rather than[m

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /opt/peda/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /opt/peda/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)
