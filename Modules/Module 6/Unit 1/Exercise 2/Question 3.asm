# Using ONLY the add, sub and slli instruction to convert the following C statement to the corresponding RISC-V assembly. 
# Assume that the variables f, g, and j are integers assigned to registers t0, t1, and t2 respectively. 
# You can use other temporary registers such as t3, t4, t5, t6, etc.

 

# f = g * 5 â€“ j * 32;
